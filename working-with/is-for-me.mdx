## The Why

Every company wants organic traffic but don't want to pay the price upfront.

So often, we hear from leaders something along these lines:

> "We're spending \$100k/mo in ads, but it's (kinda) working. We can't afford to invest \$10k/mo in content. It’s going to take too long!"

If you want to win the organic game, you have to STOP disproportionately investing in RENTING your audience and start EARNING.

## The Problem

The problem is growing organic takes a lot of work + time + 💰!

You need a solid content strategy and angle. You need to find and recruit writers and experts. You need content and copy editors. You need SEO experts, designers, etc.

We know because we’ve successfully run content for several brands like IBM, HP, ServiceTitan, HashiCorp, Scale AI, and Deepgram.

SEO/content agencies are charging \$10-15K/mo and often delivering crap content. On top of that your team is still left with a bunch of work to do.

When you are paying \$1-2/word, it’s hard to plant enough “seeds” 🌱 to figure out what is going to work for you.

## How to do Content Right

Here's a program we built for HP.

We invested ~\$5M over 4 years (this was pre-AI):

→ Published 1,900+ articles

→ Recruited ~600 contributors

→ Grew to 300K+ subscribers

→ Grew to 460K sessions/month with NO ADS

→ \$800k/mo of traffic value!

→ 5,000 leads per month

→ Biggest source of pipeline for that business unit

→ 💰millions in revenue

But here is the MAGIC 🪄...

After 4 years, the ongoing cost was almost nothing.

→ \$0.08 per session 😎

→ \$1.45 per HOUR spent on the site 🤯

🤨 OK, but I don’t have 4 years and \$5M!! 💸



## The Solution 🦾
What we learned in publishing over 10M words and building several content programs is that it’s all about planting (publishing) quality content seeds and then constantly improving on them.

🤔 But how do we accelerate planting MORE and BETTER content “seeds” 🌱 while spending LESS per seed?

From \$1-2 per word  →  \$0.10
From 5 posts/month  →  100+
To do that we had to rethink everything and take a first principles approach to content creation.



## Our Approach ⚙️

The way we solved for it is simple:

1. Start with proven tactics based on a ton of research (use AI to help)
2. Build AI workflows + automation for every step of content creation
3. Deploy a fully dedicated, hands-on SEO/content lead
4. Build and end-to-end content workflow management system
5. Calibrate the workflows and content to your brand/strategy
6. Move insanely fast to publish, refine, iterate and scale content
7. Do all the tedious groundwork as well (backlinking, staging content, cross linking, daily SEO audits, etc)
