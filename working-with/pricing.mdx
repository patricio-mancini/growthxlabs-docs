Our pricing model is simple and transparent.

> $9,000 per month

Here’s the “fine print”…

* Invoiced upfront for 3 months
* You may cancel with a 30-day notice before the next renewal term.
* Renewal terms are in three month increments.
* Cancellation mid-term will incur a fee equal to 50% of the remaining contract value.
* Credit card payments shall incur a 3% processing fee.

That’s it! Simple and transparent.

## Quick thought on ROI

Our goal is to make working with GrowthX a no-brainer! 

🤓 Our Approach

* ✅ $9,000 per month, no writers needed
* ✅ $0.10 per word (100k words published per month after onboarding)
* ✅ Fully dedicated strategist that knows your company
* ✅ We handle all the “grunt” work
* ✅ Cancel any time

🚫 Traditional Approach

* Paying an SEO agency $10-15k/month but still need to find writers
* Huge pain to find and recruiter writers who cost $1-2 per word
* Need a content marketing manager and/or editor to oversee the process
* Usually bottlenecked at 5-10 articles per month or about 10-15k words

We want our results to speak for itself. Below is an example of what we’ve been able to accomplish for Deepgram.

We like to call it the “AI-led growth effect” 🪄
