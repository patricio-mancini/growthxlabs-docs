## Q: What happens during the onboarding and discovery phase?
**A:** In Week 1, we conduct a kick-off call to introduce teams and discuss project goals. We also engage in discovery sessions to go deeper in understanding your company, product, use cases, ideal customer profile (ICP), current strategy, etc. Finally we align on expectations and how to measure success.

## Q: How do you start the project after onboarding?
**A:** In Week 2, we perform initial research to identify AI-powered content opportunities, develop a playbook for AI workflows, and start building the Content Workflow Management system.

## Q: What is the process for workflow and content calibration?
**A:** Weeks 3 and 4 involve further development and refinement of AI workflows (AirOps) and the Content Workflow Management system (usually Airtable) based on feedback.

## Q: When does content production begin?
**A:** Usually by week 5, we ramp up content production and collect feedback on the initial batches of content produced. Our goal is to always get to publishing as quickly as possible to start showing results.

## Q: How is content quality assured before publishing?
**A:** First, we use the first 6 weeks to set the right strategy and calibrate on what great quality looks like for you. We then build multiple custom AI workflows to deliver that quality programmatically and add in several human input and review steps. Finally, we use dozens of tools and standard processes to do a final QA and review of each piece of content before publishing.

## Q: What happens after the initial content launch?
**A:** After the initial content launch our goal is to aggressively refine, iterate, and scale content production based on ongoing feedback. The exact volume depends on your goals and the strategy we align on. We usually recommend a mix of creating new pages and constantly refreshing existing one.

Below is a sample content ramp up plan.

## Q: How KPIs should we measure? What would you consider success?
**A:** Our ultimate goal is to drive real revenue for your business but we understand you often have to build distribution before conversion and monetization. 

Our approach emphasizes a strong focus on controllable inputs rather than outputs. This philosophy is rooted in the belief that by optimizing the factors we can control, the desired outcomes will naturally follow over time.

Here’s how we think about it but we are open to adapting to what works best for you.

- **Phase 1 - Establish content production**

  Here we want to make sure we have a clear content strategy and a way to scale it. In this phase we’re looking at metrics like:

  - Articles published
  - Total words published
  - Pages indexed by search engines
  - Keywords ranked for (early signals that we’re publishing the right thing)

- **Phase 2 - Content refinement, enrichment and refresh**

  This is where we start to nurture existing content to continuously make them better. We want to send Google tons of signals that we’re constantly improving our content.

  - Organic search impressions
  - Organic search traffic (clicks, visits)
  - Average  CTR
  - Average position of keywords rising (top 3, 4-10, 11-20, 21-50, etc)
  - Domain authority
  - Referring domains

- **Phase 3 - Conversion to irresistible offers + nurture.**

  We like to think of this as your “front-end” offer. What is something of high value that can be a lead magnet and drive a ton of subscribers.

  - Visit → subscriber / lead 
  - Conversion by offer / by page / by topic
  - Lead volume
  - Lead engagement (open rates, etc)

- **Phase 4 - Monetization**

  We like to think of this as your “back-end” offer. While the previous steps are helping to increase your sellable surface area, this step is about finding the best ways to convert them into paying customers.

  - Lead → meeting (or product signup)
  - Meeting → sales opp (or product activation)
  - Sales opp → win (or monetization)
  - Average deal size (or average order value)
  - LTV
